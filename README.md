When running the program, make sure on the terminal used to run the "make" command first. If you are using this for the first time, you simply use make, but to reset the 
terminal and use different files, you will have to use "make clean" followed by "make". After using the make command, you will need to use "./compiler" followed by the program 
you want to test out, for example, "./compiler test1.cm" would run the test1.cm file through the compiler.
